# BNA's Not Assembly

BNA is an assembly-inspired programming language designed to keep things strict and simple. Operations are atomic, and the syntax is *close* to English.

## Language Specification

TODO

## Pronunciation
BNA  is meant to be pronounced as 'banana', but feel free to call it 'buh-nah' or just 'BNA'.
The acronym takes inspiration from other recursive acronyms, primarily GNU (GNU's Not Unix).

## Contributing
BNA is in **very** early stages, so direct code contributions most likely won't be taken. However, please offer any advice or suggestions!
